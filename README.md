**D4** brings to the Dart language and Flutter ecosystem all the power of D3 (or D3.js) — a free, open-source JavaScript library for data visualization. D4 offers a suite of low-level tool libraries that enable the creation of data-driven documents, connecting Dart and HTML, as well as dynamic and interactive visualizations for multiplatform Flutter applications — mobile, web, desktop, and embedded — from a single codebase.

See one of:

* [d4_array][] - List manipulation, ordering, searching, summarizing, etc.
* [d4_color][] - Color spaces! RGB, HSL, Cubehelix, CIELAB, and more.
* [d4_dsv][] - A parser and formatter for delimiter-separated values, such as CSV and TSV.
* [d4_format][] - Format numbers for human consumption.
* [d4_geo][] - Geographic projections, spherical shapes and spherical trigonometry.
* [d4_hierarchy][] - 2D layout algorithms for visualizing hierarchical data.
* [d4_interpolate][] - Interpolate numbers, colors, strings, lists, maps, whatever!
* [d4_path][] - Serialize Canvas path commands to SVG.
* [d4_polygon][] - Geometric operations for two-dimensional polygons.
* [d4_random][] - Generate random numbers from various distributions.
* [d4_scale][] - Encodings that map abstract data to visual representation.
* [d4_scale_chromatic][] - Sequential, diverging and categorical color scales.
* [d4_selection][] - Transform the DOM by selecting elements and joining to data.
* [d4_shape][] - Graphical primitives for visualization, such as lines and areas.
* [d4_time][] - A calculator for humanity’s peculiar conventions of time.
* [d4_time_format][] - Parse and format times, inspired by strptime and strftime.
